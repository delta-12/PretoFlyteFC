PretoFlyteFC is a simple flight controller for a small to medium-sized quadcopter and its purpose is to
stabilize roll and pitch. It primarily consists of an ESP32 microcontroller and an 9-axis LSM9DS1 inertial
measurement unit (IMU), which is equipped an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Generally, human
operators cannot react fast enough to even small perturbations in a quadcopter's flight, thus necessitating
additional control systems in the form of a flight controller to achieve stable flight. At a high level,
PretoFlyteFC works by reading in data from the accelerometer and gyroscope, filtering the signals,
inputting the filtered data and commanded angular set points into a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative)
contrl loop, and outputting roll and pitch signals that can then be used to control motor speed to achieve
the desired set point.

The original design for PretoFlyteFC was meant to control roll and pitch in addition to roll rate, pitch
rate, and yaw rate using cascaded PID for both angular and angular rate setpoints as well as implement
motor mixing and direct communication with an electronic speed controller (ESC) for the motors. However,
due to time constraints, broken parts, and difficulties communicating with the ESC, the PretoFlyteFC was
narrowed in scope to only cover control of the roll and pitch angles.

The quadcopter used to test and validate PretoFlyteFC was built from the SpeedyFPV 220 Racing Drone Kit
purchased from [Amazon.com](https://a.co/d/abwnG7r). The kit contains nearly all the essentials needed to
build an FPV (first person view) racing quadcopter, including a frame, motors, props, ESC, and even a flight
controller. The only part not included is a battery.

Inspiration and guidance for this project came from the _How to Write your own Flight Controller Software_ articles by David Such and the Carbon Aeronautics YouTube video series about how to build an drone based on Arduino.

## Justification

<!-- TODO mention limited exposure to drones -->

This project was purely a learning experience. I undertook this project because I have always been
interested in drones and UAVs but never had the time to work on a design like this. This project is also
a good opportunity to apply some of the control theory I have been studying in my mechatronics course and
to learn about signal filtering and sensor fusion. Furthermore, as someone who also plans to specifically
study drones and control theory in future courses, this project is a good introduction prior to the start
more formal study. Lastly, I plan to pursue a carrer in robotics in which all of these skills involved in
this project are very relevant and would strengthen my resume. After some initial testing and limiting the
scope of the design, I believed this project was meet the desired goals in the given time frame.

## Preliminary Design Verification

### Spinning the Motors

Some of the first parts of the quadcopter that were tested were the motors. After soldering the motors to the
ESC, the flight controller included in the kit was connected to the ESC with a provided cable. The specific
flight controller is the F4 Noxe v3 and it runs a well-known flight controller software called [Betalfight](https://betaflight.com/).
Betaflight has a software configuration tool that is used to setup and tune flight controllers running
Betaflight. The configuration tool is run on a computer connected to a Betaflight flight controller over USB.
The Betaflight configuration tool features a menu to configure and test a quadcopter's motors, which in this
case could be used to manually spin the motors to verify the worked and had be soldered correctly to the ESC.

Upon verifying the ESC and motors worked by testing them with the Betaflight configuration tool, basic test
was done to see if the ESP32 could directly communicate the ESC to control the motors. There are several
different protocols used to communicate with ESCs such as Oneshoot, Multishot and DSHOT. Raw PWM signals can
also be used. The ESC included in the kit is a 4-in-1 45A ESC running the BLHeli_S firmware, and in theory it
is capable of detecting which protocl is being used for communication on the fly without any additional input.
To test if the ESP32 could communicate with the motors, a simple Arduino program was written to output a PWM
signal on a few of the ESP32's GPIO. These GPIO were then to connected to a input pads on the ESC for each
of the four motors. A simple circuit using the LM7805 linear voltage regulator was also contructed on a
breadboard to regulate the 7-8V supplied by the ESC down to the 5V required by the ESP32. Unfortuntely, the
ESP32 was unable to control the motors by sending PWM signals to the ESC. PWM from the ESP32 running the
Arduino test program resulted in intermitent twitching motors and random spinning instead of smooth rotation.
Therefore, since the flight controller included in the kit was known to be able successfully communicate with
the ESC and smoothly spin the motors, the decision was made that the F4 Noxe v3 flight controller would act as
a gateway between the ESP32 and the ESC, with the ESP32 sending commands to the F4 Noxe which would then in turn
send commands to the ESC. To accomplish this, the ESP32 would masquerade as a radio receiver connected to the
F4 Noxe and send roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle commands to it over a serial protocol commonly used by radio
controllers called SBUS. The F4 Noxe would then use DSHOT to communicate with the ESC. It was assumed that
writing an SBUS driver for the ESP32 would also be easier than writing a driver for one of the other protocols
used to communicate directly with an ESC.

### IMU

The LSM9DS1 was chosen for this project because I already had one in my possession and fairly easy to work with.
It has largely been discontinued, but there is still plenty of support and documentation for it online. To verify
the IMU worked and communication could be established with it, a basic test program was written in Arduino and
uploaded to an Arduino Uno. The Uno was connected over SPI to the LSM9DS1 breakout board on a breadboard, and
was able to successfully print out the values of the X, Y, Z vectors for the accelerometer and gyroscope.

### Radio Transmitter/Receiver

Likewise, I was also already in possession of an old HK-T6A V2 radio transmitter and receiver. This a six-channel,
2.4 GHz digital proportional radio control system. Documentation for this radio system is scarce, especially
given that is discontinued. These older radio controllers often use PWM or PPM to communicate. In order to
determine which protocol this particular radio uses, receiver channels were connected to an oscilliscope while
the sticks, switches, and knobs on the radio transmitter were actuated. The scope displayed PWM signals and
measured the frequency to be around 50Hz with duty cycles varying between 4% and 10% depending on the position
or state of a given input to the transmitter.
